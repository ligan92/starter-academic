  Thesis on the exclusion statistics and lattice random walks.
  The main fields of interest are combinatorial issues pertaining to the algebraic area of 2D lattice random walks and their continuous Brownian limit, and various implications for the associated quantum models, especially in the field of exclusion statistics, where particles exhibit stronger exclusion than Pauli. It may be generalized to other types of counting, or to higher-dimensional objects (strings, etc.).
